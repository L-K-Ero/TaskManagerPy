# TaskManagerPy
python version for use on non-android devices.


replace beeps.wav with whatever horrid sound your employees hate, that way tasks get done :3

future updates: 
  alert the boss if tasks go undone after a gross amount of time ( variable ), and have that be in the Admin app for easy changeability ( for my old boss who cant write code )
  add more settings to the admin page.
  add a confirmation to exiting the program. ( since data gets lost in the cache but that just means when it gets restarted ( and not at midnight ), they will have to clear tasks again :3
